# Create Indigo App

This project serves as a starting point for React applications, tailored to include essential, and minimum, configurations and files for immediate development. It's a custom scaffold built on top of React to fit the specific workflow and tooling preferences. Designed and inspired by the simplicity of [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/) in mind, and devoided of create-react-app _shudders_.

2. Copy the files into your new project directory.
3. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.

## Features

- Pre-configured ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting.
- Babel set up for advanced JavaScript features.
